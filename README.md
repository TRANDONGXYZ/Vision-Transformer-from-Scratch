# Vision Transformer from Scratch

In this project, I'm going to be replicating a machine learning research paper and creating a Vision Transformer (ViT) from scratch using PyTorch. You can find the original paper in [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11929.pdf). This model has been trained on dataset of food images to classify types of food including _pizza_, _steak_, _sushi_.
